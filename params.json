This workshop is aimed at helping potential founders get prototype websites up. With a prototype website, you can run ads, test conversion, and potentially estimate revenue without having to take on the risk of building it.\r\n\r\nIf your experiments work, you will have a compelling case to show to investors or potential hires to help make your dream a reality.\r\n\r\nIf your experiments don't work, you'll be able to figure out what went wrong and fix them before investing substantial resources. \r\n\r\nTry hard, fail fast.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
